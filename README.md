# üî• P-y-r-o Community Edition

**P-y-r-o Community Edition** is striving to be a fully self-hosted, open-source edition of our enterprise ad tech platform Pyro by Firebay Studios.

> **üöÄ Need the Enterprise Cloud Version?**  
> Visit our [Enterprise Cloud Version](https://project-isildor.vercel.app/) for a managed solution with premium features.  
> Contact: [kjayamanna@firebaystudios.com](mailto:kjayamanna@firebaystudios.com) if you'd like to explore the Enterprise Cloud Version for free for 7 days.

## üìñ Current State

We launched the community edition of our product to empower solopreneurs to create their own radio ads for free as a standalone solution. At present, the platform relies on hosted services such as AWS, Firebase, and ElevenLabs. However, our goal is to evolve it into a fully self-sustained, offline-capable platform.

We welcome contributors who share this vision! If you're interested in helping us achieve this milestone, we‚Äôd love to see your pull requests (PRs). üöÄ
